# Astrology Trading Automation

This project provides a Python script to detect significant astrological events — specifically angular aspects (like squares) between planets such as the Moon and Saturn — using Swiss Ephemeris data. The output is saved as a CSV file containing event timestamps and planetary positions. Additionally, a MetaTrader 4 (MQL4) expert advisor example is included to read the CSV file and automatically open trading positions based on these astrological events.

## Features

- Calculate angular differences and latitudes between planets using Swiss Ephemeris.
- Automatically detect close-to-exact square aspects within a specified time range.
- Refine event times to minute-level accuracy.
- Export results to a CSV file for easy integration.
- MQL4 code to read the CSV file and open trades (buy/sell) in MetaTrader 4 based on astrology signals.
- Fully customizable configuration for planets, angles, tolerances, and date ranges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `swisseph` Python library (`pip install pyswisseph`)
- Ephemeris data files (`sepl_18.se1`, `semo_18.se1`) placed in your configured ephemeris folder
- MetaTrader 4 platform to run MQL4 expert advisor

### Running the Python Script

1. Configure the `EPHE_PATH` in the Python script to point to your ephemeris files directory.
2. Set your desired date range, planets, and tolerance.
3. Run the script to generate the CSV file of astrological event timestamps.

```bash
python moon_saturn_squares.py
